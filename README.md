<h2>CRM</h2>

<p><strong>The CRM collections by default has more apps. Them will be uploaded in near future.</strong></p>

<br>

<p>CRM is a collection with apps, themes and plugins for the Midrub CMS. </p>

<br>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The main goal of this collection is to provide an advanced and original CRM which allows not only to manage the clients and products, but the main goal is to achieve new clients.
I have worked on the base about 1 year and 4 months and i have edited it completely multiple times in this time because there were always new ideas to make it perfect. For example the CRM Clients app don't provides you only the tools to create a list with clients. This is basic feature which has any CRM. My app allows you to invent the types of fields and decide which is required and which is optional. Based on this information, the CRM Automations will be able to understand if the client's field is valid or no. The CRM Automations App automatizes the CRM Clients app. The CRM Clients allows you even to use a search result or even a full list for telemarketing and save the new achieved information. It saves any action done by a team's member and the administrator of the team could see all actions done. The CRM Clients app allows even to create folders for clients roles, create notes for clients, generate reports, update a field or multiple fields in a search results and much more features. You could decide what will be able to do your team's members by role.</p>
<p>And CRM Clients is only one app in the collection, but there are several similar(for high number of features) available by default.</p>

<br>

<h4>Structure</h4>
<p>The CRM's collection uses the Midrub CMS cache feature to save the data. This allows to load the pages faster and the hooks are deleting the saved cache when the data is updated, deleted or added new data. I have divided in the CRM the cache in collections of files to not create one single file. The goal is to make anything more fast.</p>
<p>Each app has support for webhooks request, cron job requests and rest requests.</p>
<p>Users have advanced features to manage their team and to see the activity of each team. In the Settings page the user is able even to see the plan's usage.</p>
<p>The Midrub CMS allows to the administrator to show ads, notifications and the CRM has support for this feature. </p>
<p>Each app could add options in the CRM Settings app, search options in the CRM Dashboard app, widgets in the CRM Dashboard app, permissions in the CRM Team app, triggers and actions in the CRM Automations app and data in CRM Planner app.</p>
<p>User is able to see the date in the wanted format and with timezone. Each user could upload a profile's image and upload for their team's members.</p>
<p>If you don't like the default icons, you could use the Icons Manager plugin to change the icons and your icons will be displayed forever in all old and new installed apps.</p>
<p>If you don't like the fonts, you could use your own fonts. Same for colors.</p>
<p>If you don't like how looks an element in your website, you could custom it from one file and you will have the customizations in any old or new installed app for that element. This means the CRM has a library with elements and all apps are using the library for html. I won't create new apps without the library support. You could redesign forever the look of the website and it will look as you wish.</p>
<p>If you don't like a CRM app, you could delete it and create your own similar, with same functions and it will work as an alternative.</p>
<p>Each app has support for Quick Guides box and the administrator is able to write them in multiple languages directly from the administrator panel.</p>

<br>

<h4>Advantages</h4>
<p>You have a ready to use business base with SAAS support and anything you need to sell your services. You could use the existing apps or create your own fast and integrate in this base which has anything.</p>
Until february i'm going to release at least 10 chatbots for the CRM Apps directory(which is integrated in the CRM collection by default) but after will be released very complex and useful apps which you're seeing only to the middle - big business and you can't buy such complex scripts. Therefore, you will have a lot of original services to sell to your clients.</p>

<br>

<h4>Updates</h4>
<p>You could get updates with a click from the administrator panel. You could create your own apps for the CRM and provide updates in same way. The updates are providing from Dropbox or Google Drive. Ensure your server don't has resctrions for these.</p>

<br>

<h4>Font Icons</h4>
<p>The CRM collection uses two font's icons https://remixicon.com/ and https://fonts.google.com/</p>

<br>

<h4>Libraries</h4>

<p>jQuery.</p>
<p>ApexCharts</p>
